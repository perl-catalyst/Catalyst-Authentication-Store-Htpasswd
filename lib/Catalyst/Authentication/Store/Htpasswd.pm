=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin uses L<Authen::Htpasswd> to let your application use C<< .htpasswd >>
files for its authentication storage.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Simple constructor, dies if the htpassword file can't be found

=head2 find_user

Looks up the user, and returns a Catalyst::Authentication::Store::Htpasswd::User object.

=head2 user_supports

Delegates to L<< Catalyst::Authentication::User->supports|Catalyst::Authentication::User/supports >> or an
override in L<user_class|/user_class>.

=head2 from_session

Delegates the user lookup to L<find_user|/find_user>

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 file

The path to the htpasswd file. If the path starts with a slash, then it is assumed to be a fully
qualified path, otherwise the path is fed through C<< $c->path_to >> and so normalised to the
application root.

Alternatively, it is possible to pass in an L<Authen::Htpasswd> object here, and this will be
used as the htpasswd file.

=head2 user_class

Change the user class which this store returns. Defaults to L<Catalyst::Authentication::Store::Htpasswd::User>.
This can be used to add additional functionality to the user class by sub-classing it, but will not normally be
needed.

=head2 user_field

Change the field that the username is found in in the information passed into the call to C<< $c->authenticate() >>.

This defaults to I< username >, and generally you should be able to use the module as shown in the synopsis, however
if you need a different field name then this setting can change the default.

Example:

    __PACKAGE__->config( authentication => { realms => { test => {
                    store => {
                        class => 'Htpasswd',
                        user_field => 'email_address',
                    },
    }}});
    # Later in your code
    $c->authenticate({ email_address => $c->req->param("email"), password => $c->req->param("password") });
